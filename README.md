Yet another renamer, really!


This is part tool to help me, part learning about Javascript (promises, bleugh) and Electron in particular.

It's SUPER nasty, but it should get smoother over time.

Please feel free to use or fork, but I ask you to please contribute back to this repo so that I can learn how to
write better JS, and make a better tool for everyone.
