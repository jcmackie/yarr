# yarr
Yet another renamer, really!


This is part tool to help me, part learning about Javascript (promises, bleugh) and Electron in particular.

It's SUPER nasty, but it should get smoother over time.

Please feel free to use or fork, but I ask you to please contribute back to this repo so that I can learn how to
write better JS, and make a better tool for everyone.


## How to use
Have NPM installed:
https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

To install npm modules
```
$ npm install
```

To run Yarr
```
$ npm start
```

## License
Currently licensed using GPLv2. I'm happy to accept pull requests especially from all the JS gurus out there.

If you want to change the license then message me to have a discussion about it.
